# Maximum Awesome

Config files for vim and tmux, lovingly tended by a small subculture of
peace-loving hippies. Modified for Linux

## What's in it?

* [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/)
* VIM
* ZSH
* Oh-My-ZSH!

### vim

* `,d` brings up [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree), a sidebar buffer for navigating and manipulating files
* `,t` brings up [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim), a project file filter for easily opening specific files
* `,b` restricts ctrlp.vim to open buffers
* `,a` starts project search with [ack.vim](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim) using [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) (like ack)
* `ds`/`cs` delete/change surrounding characters (e.g. `"Hey!"` + `ds"` = `Hey!`, `"Hey!"` + `cs"'` = `'Hey!'`) with [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
* `\\\` toggles current line comment
* `\\` toggles visual selection comment lines
* `vii`/`vai` visually select *in* or *around* the cursor's indent
* `,[space]` strips trailing whitespace
* `^]` jump to definition using ctags
* `,l` begins aligning lines on a string, usually used as `,l=` to align assignments
* `^hjkl` move between windows, shorthand for `^w hjkl`

### tmux

* `^a` is the prefix
* `prefix v` makes a vertical split
* `prefix s` makes a horizontal split
